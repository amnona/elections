## analysis of vote migration in israel elections

We assume a constant party->party migration across all voting locations, and use each voting location as an experiment.
Hence we get a set of linear equations, which are solved to estimate the party->party vote migration (also including missing/abstained votes as another party).
Results for the 2022 elections are plotted as a sankey plot.
